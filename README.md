A python program displaying a menu integrating operations in concepts like Hadoop, AWS, and others.

-> Remember to follow proper indentation while working on menu.py<br>
-> Try to comment specific function operations above the functions you create, for better understanding<br>
-> Remember to commit only to the branch that you create, and then PR. I shall review the changes and merge the commit if there are no issues.<br>

HAPPY CODING.
